        <prosody rate="medium" pitch="low">Ugh, you won't believe this morning.  </prosody>
        The alarm clock went off at <say-as interpret-as="time" format="hms12">6:00 AM</say-as> sharp, not with the calming nature sounds, but with a foghorn!  Seriously? <break strength="x-weak"/> Two hours of sleep? <break strength="x-weak"/>
        <prosody rate="fast" pitch="high">Fantastic. </prosody> Look at these dark circles - concealer isn't cheap these days. <prosody rate="medium" pitch="low">Anyway, the dentist appointment is at <say-as interpret-as="time" format="hms12">3:15 PM</say-as> today.</prosody><break strength="x-strong" />
        <prosody rate="slow" pitch="very low">Fun. </prosody> At least it's only <say-as interpret-as='currency' language='en-US'>$85</say-as> this time. Last time was a nightmare. <prosody rate="x-slow" pitch="very low">Maybe I should've just stayed in bed...</prosody> <prosody rate="medium" pitch="low">Okay, gotta focus. Work emails, grocery shopping... and those library books are two weeks overdue!</prosody><break strength="x-strong" />
        <prosody rate="x-slow" pitch="very low">Self-checkout is probably out of the question. </prosody> <break strength="x-strong" />But let me check if the librarian is ready to help me out. I usually don't have items overdue, I hope they don't charge me with a late fee. Other than that, life is going good, I am liking my work and my colleagues are great! I hope you are doing good too, it's been a while we haven't met, I think we should catch up sometime soon.
        How about the next weekend?<break strength="x-weak" />At Cafe Stella <break strength="x-weak" />- like old times - common ya, it will be fun! Why don't you bring Nitin and Soham along - it's been a while I have met them, what are they up to? I last heard Soham is studying at the University of Michigan! That's a great school - hope he is having fun!
        <break strength="x-strong" />
        It's important to stay connected and nurture relationships. Remember, life's best moments are often shared with friends and loved ones. Don't let the busyness of life keep you from making meaningful connections.
