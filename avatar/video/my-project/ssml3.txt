Hello, I am Lisa. Let me show you how to create an engaging avatar video in four steps.<break strength="x-strong" />
It begins with a talking script for your avatar. You can get started with a text file. However, we recommend to use the Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) for advanced requirements. <break strength="x-strong" />
Ugh, you won't believe this morning. The alarm clock went off at <say-as interpret-as="time" format="hms12">6:00 AM</say-as> sharp, not with the calming nature sounds, but with a foghorn! <break strength="x-strong" />
Seriously? <break strength="x-weak"/> Two hours of sleep? <break strength="x-weak"/>
Fantastic. Look at these dark circles - concealer isn't cheap these days. Anyway, the dentist appointment is at <say-as interpret-as="time" format="hms12">3:15 PM</say-as> today. Fun. 
At least it's only <say-as interpret-as='currency' language='en-US'>$85</say-as> this time. Last time was a nightmare. Maybe I should've just stayed in bed...Okay, gotta focus. Work emails, grocery shopping... and those library books are two weeks overdue!<break strength="x-strong" />
Self-checkout is probably out of the question.<break strength="x-strong" /> But let me check if the librarian is ready to help me out. I usually don't have items overdue, I hope they don't charge me with a late fee. 
Other than that, life is going good, I am liking my work and my colleagues are great! I hope you are doing good too, it's been a while we haven't met, I think we should catch up sometime soon.
How about the next weekend? At Cafe Stella <break strength="x-weak" /> like old times, common ya, it will be fun! Why don't you bring Nitin and Soham along - it's been a while I have met them, what are they up to? 
I last heard Soham is studying at the University of Michigan! That's a great school - hope he is having fun!
